excerpt: ' Motivated by the recent surge in research dedicated to the mitigation of racial bias
in deep-learning based Facial Recognition(FR) systems, this investigation focused on an assessment and architectural implementation of Information Maximization Adaptation Network(IMAN), a promising Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) approach that addresses racial bias through transfer recognition knowledge that addresses
