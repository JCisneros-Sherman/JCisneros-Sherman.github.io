title: "Higher Education and the Automation of Inequality through “Inattentional Blindness” : Survey Study"
collection: publications

excerpt: '“Inattentional blindness” refers to the phenomenon of algorithmic biases that emerge when the system developers fail to capture the desired complex real-world goals in their target variables and problem specifications procedures. As such, the main objective of this study was to examine the materialization of this phenomenon in higher education. And investigate if the pattern of “inattentional blindness” currently aggravating the technology industry, is also observed among the diverse student body of a public, four-year, federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).'

ABSTRACT

The accelerating incorporation and reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data-Driven
algorithms that assist us in sensitive domains such as education, social services, and the criminal justice
system, have provided technology systems the power to automate inequality through algorithmic
discrimination. Recent research has identified the narrow technical approaches technologists often take to
solve social problems (known as “_inattentional blindness_”) as one of the main contributors to algorithmic
bias and discrimination in AI systems. However, there is little research examining the materialization of
this phenomenon in higher education. As such, we conducted a quantitative survey study among
California State University Dominguez Hills(CSUDH) students in the _Computer Science/Technology_
related fields, to investigate if this phenomenon is also observed among university students. Our
investigation employed a survey questionnaire designed to quantify the “level of significance”
participants attributed to statements from two distinct categories, one associated with important _Social &
Ethical_ real-world considerations of technology systems and the other one associated with _Technical &
Economic_ ones. Results demonstrated that students in the _Computer Science/Technology_ fields attribute a
greater overall significance to _Technical & Economic_ considerations in comparison with important _Social
& Ethical_ ones. A compelling indication that “_inattentional blindness_” might also be a considerably
persistent pattern among university students.
